          <div className="space-y-4 mt-4">
            <p>A personal trainer (PT) is a certified individual who has the knowledge, skills and abilities to design safe and effective exercise programmes.</p>
            <p>They help their clients to achieve health and fitness goals, such as fat loss, muscle gain, improved sports performance and various other aims, by delivering a safe and effective workout programme, and providing guidance, support, and motivation.</p>
            <p>Many Personal Trainers choose a career within the fitness industry as they have undertaken their own journey and are passionate about helping others achieve their health and fitness goals. You might look at a PT and think they have always been physically fit, but often they know what it’s like to be new to a gym environment and not knowing where to start.</p>

          <h1 className="font-judul text-4xl">WHAT IS A PERSONAL TRAINER?</h1>
          <p className="font-black mt-4">There are several benefits of personal training. These include:</p>
          <ul className="space-y-4 mt-4 list-disc ml-5">
            <li>Learning the correct form: A Personal Trainer will guide you on how to perform exercises correctly and safely, making sure you target the right muscles while preventing injuries. Even the most experienced gym goers can struggle with form!</li>
            <li>Knowledge and experience: Personal Trainers have a huge wealth of knowledge on everything from the human anatomy to the best training methods. Working with a PT means you benefit from this information without needing to do the research yourself, or having to trial methods which are not effective.</li>
            <li>Pushing your limits: Personal Trainers are passionate and supportive, but they’ll also challenge and motivate you to push yourself further. It is much easier to break through a plateau or smash personal bests when working with a PT!</li>
            <li>Being held accountable: Sometimes, the toughest battle is getting to the gym. Having a Personal Trainer keeps you accountable on your health and fitness journey, so you can reach your goals quicker.</li>
            <li>Getting a bespoke training programme: There is no one size fits all when it comes to fitness. Personal Trainers will create a tailored training programme to suit your needs, abilities and goals, making sure it is challenging but achievable.</li>
